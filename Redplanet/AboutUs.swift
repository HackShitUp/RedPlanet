        "Redplanet is a media company.\n\nWe believe that we are the best platform for people to consume news, not only about their frieds, but also about the world.\n\nUnlike other social media platforms, we have two models of relationships that help us curate your newsfeeds the way you want it to - Friends and Following. While 'friends' are mutual relationships, 'following'is not. You should be friends with the people you know in your life, and follow others of your interest.\n\nWe’ve thought quite a while to figure out exactly what Redplanet might be for our community, and we’ve come to our initial intentions of what we wanted Redplanet to be in the first place. So, let’s talk about them:\n\n• What is Redplanet as a product or service?\n\nHave you ever scrolled through your newsfeed and wished you could curate it?\n\nWe realized that social media is no longer a place for friends to communicate and share content because there’s essentially TWO groups that co-exist in a social-media ecosystem:\n(1) Our friends and families.\n(2) Content creators such as brands, aspiring artists, organizations, publishers, celebrities, etc.\nYet, current social media platforms offer no way to distinguish the former from the latter. As a result, our newsfeed is cluttered with all types of content, from different people. But what might frustrate us the most about this is that it intervenes with our streamlined experience. It’s not that we don’t want to see “irrelevant content” it’s that we’d rather see them in a different space, outside of our friends’.\nSo in essence, Redplanet is the first social media app that curates your newsfeed. It does this by dividing your newsfeeds in two: One for your friends, and one for the things you’re following.\n\nADD YOUR FRIENDS, AND FOLLOW THE THINGS YOU LOVE…\n\nFor more information about the value we deliver, check out our story on Medium: https://medium.com/@redplanetapp/saluton-mondo-be1f2c1ddbc7#.y1m6qz97r\n\n• Why does Redplanet exist, and what does it stand for?\n\nWe didn’t want Redplanet to exist merely as a social media app. We also wanted some meaning as to why we exist. Our business philosophy, or our values, are quite simple:\nWe believe that we should always imagine “what if,” and challenge the status quo.
